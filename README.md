**Dockerfile Overview**

**Base Image**

This Dockerfile starts with the node:latest image, which provides a pre-configured environment for running Node.js applications.

**Environment Variables**

Two environment variables are set within the Dockerfile:

MONGO_DB_USERNAME: Specifies the username for accessing MongoDB.

MONGO_DB_PWD: Specifies the password for accessing MongoDB.

These variables are utilized within the Dockerfile to configure the MongoDB connection.

**Directory Setup**

A directory named app is created within the container at /home/app using mkdir -p /home/app. This directory will be used to store the application files.

Application files are then copied from the local machine's ./app directory into the /home/app directory within the container.

**Working Directory**

The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for subsequent instructions to /home/app. This ensures that all following commands are executed within the /home/app directory, simplifying the command structure.

**Dependency Installation**

The npm install command is executed within the /home/app directory to install the Node.js application dependencies. This command utilizes the package.json file present in the application directory to install the required packages.

**Command Execution**

The default command (CMD) specified in the Dockerfile is ["node", "server.js"]. This command instructs Docker to run the server.js file using Node.js within the /home/app directory. This assumes that server.js is the entry point for the Node.js application.
