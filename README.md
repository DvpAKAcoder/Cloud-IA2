**#Dockerfile Overview**

**1.Base Image**

This Dockerfile starts with the node:latest image, which provides a pre-configured environment for running Node.js applications.

**2.Environment Variables**

Two environment variables are set within the Dockerfile:

MONGO_DB_USERNAME: Specifies the username for accessing MongoDB.

MONGO_DB_PWD: Specifies the password for accessing MongoDB.

These variables are utilized within the Dockerfile to configure the MongoDB connection.

**3.Directory Setup**

A directory named app is created within the container at /home/app using mkdir -p /home/app. This directory will be used to store the application files.

Application files are then copied from the local machine's ./app directory into the /home/app directory within the container.

**4.Working Directory**

The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for subsequent instructions to /home/app. This ensures that all following commands are executed within the /home/app directory, simplifying the command structure.

**5.Dependency Installation**

The npm install command is executed within the /home/app directory to install the Node.js application dependencies. This command utilizes the package.json file present in the application directory to install the required packages.

**6.Command Execution**

The default command (CMD) specified in the Dockerfile is ["node", "server.js"]. This command instructs Docker to run the server.js file using Node.js within the /home/app directory. This assumes that server.js is the entry point for the Node.js application.

**Docker Compose Overview**

**Services**

The Docker Compose file defines three services:

**my-app:**
   Image: dvp2003/firstimage:latest
   
   Container Name: 21BCP260-app-container
   
   Ports: Mapping port 3000 of the host machine to port 3000 of the container. This exposes the Node.js application to the host machine.
   
**mongodb:**

   Image: mongo
   
   Container Name: 21BCP260-database-container
   
   Restart Policy: always (to ensure that the MongoDB container restarts automatically in case of failure)
   
   Ports: Mapping port 27017 of the host machine to port 27017 of the container. This exposes the MongoDB database to the host machine.
   
   Environment Variables: Setting up the root username and password for MongoDB initialization.
   
   Volumes: Mounting a volume named mongo-data to persist MongoDB data between container restarts.
   
**mongo-express:**

   Image: mongo-express

   Restart Policy: always (to handle scenarios where MongoDB might not be ready when mongo-express starts)
   
   Ports: Mapping port 8080 of the host machine to port 8081 of the container. This exposes the MongoDB management tool to the host machine.
   
   Environment Variables: Configuring the admin username, password, and server for MongoDB.
   
**Volumes**

   mongo-data: A named volume used to persist MongoDB data. This ensures that data stored in the MongoDB database remains intact even if the container is stopped or removed.
